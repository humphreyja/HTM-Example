### Neurons
* Have a single set(SDR) with 20% of data being 1s the other being 0s
* Have a list of Synapses(SDR) with a strength between 0 and 1 with a threshold or .4
* Have a smaller list of Synapses(SDR) with the same configuration as above but will exist from different regions

Cells are patterns, to validate that the pattern is a match, simply check if the pattern is a subset of its single core set.
