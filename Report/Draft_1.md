### Programming Intelligence

What is intelligence?  What makes something intelligent?  Can we consider dolphins to be intelligent?  They have a larger Neocortex than humans do but yet we are the dominate species on the planet.  Certainly we do not consider dolphins to be smarter than humans, but from a perspective of the biology of the brain, they should be smarter than humans.  

Lets try to solve the first set of questions; what is intelligence and what makes something intelligent.  The common answer to this is how something behaves.  If it behaves intelligent then it is intelligent.  Many programmers have fallen under this thought process and try to write programs that respond with behavior that seems intelligent.  For example, Watson is an Artificial Intelligence that is capable of responding with intelligent answers.  Is Watson capable of making complements, coming up with jokes or stories and capable of determining if they are awful or not, or having ambitions?  The programmers at IBM who built Watson could program Watson to select from a list of fields and set one of them as the ambition that Watson will frame its life around.  If we then give Watson some time to work on his ambitions and revisit it on a later date, it may seem like it is intelligent because of the accumulated knowledge that it has built in that field.  It is still incapable of changing its ambitions based on something external.  We call this curiosity.  Curiosity allows humans to solve problems and to find passion in life.  We are all different because of what we are curious about.  How can a programmer develop an Intelligence that can be selective in what it is curious about?  It is a specific behavior of intelligent beings that the behavior approach of programming cannot mimic.  

Neural Nets are a representation of a network of neurons, so can this not be intelligent?  The answer is actually complicated.  For example, say I take a computer back to the 1800s.  Scientists in that era would dissect it and see that it operates using transistors.  They find that combining a few transistors exhibits the same behavior as the original computer such as simple mathematical equations.  Could you consider that as equivalent to the original computer?  This is the same situation as Neural Nets.  If researchers are able to combine the 'neurons' into the correct configuration, it could potentially be intelligent as it would be a copy of the human brain.  

Lets use another thought experiment **proposed** by Jeff Hawkins, head of the Numenta project.  Imagine a box with a slot to pass a paper through, a book with a set of instructions, and a person inside who does not know Chinese.  On the outside, another person passes a paper into the box with a bunch of Chinese questions on it that the person on the inside has to answer and pass back out.  The person on the inside then uses the book of instructions to figure out which Chinese symbol to write based on the symbols used in the question.  Then the paper is returned to the person waiting outside.  The questions were all answered correctly, some even thoughtfully.  The person on the inside had no clue what they were writing down, they simply just followed the book of instructions.  Can we consider this box model as intelligent?  It is exhibiting intelligent behavior but the answers would be the same no matter what if all of the conditions are the same.  All of the intelligence of the person on the inside is being removed by using a language they do not know and a book of instructions for them.  This is effectively what a computer does.  Artificial Intelligence is just a better book of instructions that can mimic human behavior, it is not Intelligent.  

So what is intelligence then?  If behaving is not intelligent then what is?  Jeff Hawkins proposes that it is prediction that makes humans intelligent.  Lets explore this further.

The brain is constantly receiving input through its various senses.  Everything that the brain does also receives feedback.  For example, your brain tells you to walk forward, your feet send feedback back to the brain about things like what the ground feels like and what state your feet are in.  Jeff Hawkins has studied the brain for years and found that when it receives feedback, the brain is using that for prediction.  To explain, take a child.  A child will often venture into dangerous situations because they do not know better but quickly learn once they get hurt.  If their brain tells them to touch the red hot coals, they will do so and get burned.  The hand sends feedback about getting burnt back to the brain and the brain creates an association between red coals and pain.  Next time the brain sees or senses that there are red hot coals near, they predict they will get burnt.  This can also be used for learning.  Learning to walk is learned through experimenting.  Once a child takes their first step, the brain creates an association that by doing the same muscle movements, it predicts that it will walk.  All behavior is learned and can be changed by adjusting the prediction relationships.  Learning new concepts can be done the same way.  The brain receives input from its ears explaining physics and creates associations with things like mathematical formulas, for example.  When referring back to physics, you also remember the formulas related.

Jeff Hawkins is only concerned with how the Neocortex which explains how we learn but not why we learn.  My model takes the learning part from Jeff Hawkins' model and supplements it with an explanation for why we learn.  First, lets dig deeper into how exactly Jeff Hawkins model of prediction can be programmed and then get into how my model works with his.
