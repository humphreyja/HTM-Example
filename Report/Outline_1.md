1. Defining Intelligence
    - Why the most popular methods are not...
      - Neural Nets
      - Watson
      - Deep Learning
    - ...and why they could be
2. A new model
  - An intelligent mind requires
    - Memory (auto-associative and sequential)
    - Predictions
    - Desire
  - How I model…
    - Memory
      - Storage
      - Retrieval
    - Predictions
      - Feedback theory
    - Desire
      - Emotion
        - Negative feelings
        - Positive Feelings
  - Why Emotion is key to intelligence
    - Why can’t Watson beat the Turing Test
      - Input/Output Machines
      - Thinking Machines
    - A possibility that a computer could beat the Turing Test without being intelligent
    - Why computers may never beat the Turing Test
3. A Programmer’s View
  - Linked Tree structure
    - A branch is a column.  When one fires, the column fires
    - The lowest level is linked to the highest level providing feedback
    - Each column is also highly connected to all other columns (like 90% is connected to outward sources), so not just a simple tree, closer to a graph but still has hierarchy.  
  - Concept Memory
    - Doesn’t store information as a representation of what was inputed
    - Stores the concept of that information
    - Allows for multiple concepts to be combined
  - Builds the representation of that concept by sending the information down the Tree structure.
    - Depending on the desired output, it will build the object in different ways
    - If it doesn’t exist for that output, then try closest attempt and create “neurons” that implement that path, effectively teaching itself that method.
  - If it encounters something that it has never come across, create “neurons” to build the path.  Breaks down the object into the different parts of it creating the hierarchy tree.
